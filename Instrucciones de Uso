Tepey√≥llotl is a program that allows us to filter seismic data, these seismic data are test data from Apollo 12, 15 and 16 space missions, as well as Mars InSight.
From the test data we have not all the signals are from earthquakes, so the Tepeyollotl filter helps us to classify those frequencies that give us the impression of an earthquake.
As first stay we have the data of the moon and mars, these data are in CSV type, and conform data of absolute time, relative time and velocity.
The files are located in two free form drive folders, so you can add these folders to your home (by direct access).
Moon data folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18GQ9ARaDnqMdBxV50Tt8oOTQfxVm-FEN?usp=drive_link 
Mars data folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TsOXsP5ZjU5ODXULMXiXqKJ_r49XqwGA?usp=drive_link

Once the data is loaded we have the codes which can be found in this repository with the names:
These codes can be used by copying the code to a Google Colab file or using the respective Colab links 
Code for earthquakes on the moon:
Code for earthquakes on the moon:

Note: Although the codes are the same, there are changes in the name of each of the CSV files, so in order not to create confusion it was decided to create two different codes. 

Once we have the code in Colab we only have to copy the path to the folder and run the program.


We hope that the demo is just the beginning of a long term investment that will help us not only to detect an earthquake, but also to understand the composition of the planets.
